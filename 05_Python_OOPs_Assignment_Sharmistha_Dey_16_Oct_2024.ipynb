        "\n",
        "Class: Class is defined as a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects created from the class will have. For example, a Car class might have attributes like color and model, and methods like start() and stop().\n",
        "\n",
        "Object: Objects are an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated until an object is created from it. Objects hold the actual data and the functionality that is defined in the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the practice of hiding the internal state and functionality of an object and only exposing a limited interface. In Python, encapsulation is achieved through access modifiers like public, private, and protected attributes or methods (e.g., prefixing with underscores).\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance: It is a mechanism for creating a new class that reuses, extends, or modifies the behavior of an existing class. The new class (called a child or subclass) inherits the properties and methods of the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism: The ability to use a common interface for different data types. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common super class. In Python, this is often used with method overriding and operator overloading.\n",
        "\n",
        "These core concepts help in designing flexible, reusable, and organized code using OOP principles."
